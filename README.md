# purescript-read-dts 

## Working in progress

This is a fork of the original [purescript-read-dts](https://github.com/purescript-codegen/purescript-read-dts) library, which is very rough and contains a lot of quick hacks. The goal of this fork is to rewrite some parts of the library to make it more robust and easier to use.

## Testing

Check the tests for the examples of usage. You can run them with:

```
$ spago test
```

## Credits
